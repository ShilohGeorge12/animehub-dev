			"content": "Welcome to Demon School Ikruma-kun and Mashle are both fun comedy anime that I love and would recommend. Although the main characters are very different they along with the overall setting share similarities that I believe make each series a good recommendation. Similarities in Main Character - Mash and Iruma are both highschool aged boys that are powerless. They do not possess magic and they are just humans. Both of the go to a school full of people that can use magic and even fly while they cannot. Both characters quickly make friends and are overall kind people. They both hide their true identities because it is dangerous for others to know who they really are. Differences - Mash is a very nonchalant character and isn't too expressive while Iruma is much more fearful of his situation in the beginning. Although both characters are good people, Iruma is more inclined to help others and use kind language while Mash is more of a kuudere-esque character. He acts before he thinks and does not express much fear or anger even when he feels it. Mash has a good heart but does not go out of his way to say the kind of things that Iruma would to butter people up. Iruma is a regular human in a world of demons. He does not have his own power and much of his fear comes from that. Although Mash lives in a world full of magic users, his physical strength is incredible. Some may say he is very confident in his strength but Mash just tries to use it for everything without thinking about the consequences. The setting is similar in the way that both worlds are filled with characters that can use different kinds of magic. It is the norm to have powers and fly (with wings in Iruma-kun and a broom in Mashle). The MCs both climb the ranks at their respective schools although Mash does it for an overarching goal. Both shows are comedies and have likable characters and some good character development. I watched Mashle in sub and Welcome to Demon School in dub. I love the sub for Mashle although the dub in Iruma-kun is not the best of all the comedy anime that I have watched, it isn't Golden Time so 7/10 for me.",

The only difference is that here, (Hayato) he\u2019s encountering 5 female maids and almost going into harem mode and he doesn\u2019t like the cafe and isn\u2019t a pervy guy but the misunderstandings can lead to assuming him to be a pervert. In Blend S two guys get their own love on just one person so not really a harem moment and they don\u2019t hate the cafe much. The male protagonist (Dino) can sometimes be pervy and just like I said, the misunderstandings can lead him to being assumed as a pervert, same goes with Akizuki. I can even include the meme that Blend S has, but for now it doesn\u2019t have, so sooner or later this anime could get a meme too. They both play similarity it\u2019s just that only the male characters opposites to each other in their own animes.",

In both shows, the main focus of the story is our protagonist, traveling in solitude with the sole company of their mechanical companions, and in their journeys, they do encounter various parables, which rarely can be resolved with force or violence. Also, in both shows, the existential themes and it's presentation are largely pondered upon, presenting us a journey of both the mind and heart.",

This is more true of the second and third season but you need to start here. If you can look past the ingrained prejudice that you might have against Isekai and if you don't mind something a bit more light hearted and aren't committed to the idea that anime needs to be either artsy or overly edgy to be good then you might find something you like here.",

Both stories culminate in a sort of grand cataclysm that attempts to give insight into the human condition. One could find many parallels plotwise, and given their functions in the plot there is a number of characters who are much alike one another: Anthy-Rei, Akio-Gendo, Mikage-Ritsuko, Nanami-Kaji, Touga-Misato, Utena-Shinji. This is not my novel-sized essay on the many and deep similarities between the two shows, so you'll just have to trust me on it. And Anno and Ikuhara are close friends, too. Utena is less depressive for the most part, and a bit less experimental, while it deals more with actual relationships.",

FLCL features a female character who is spunky and upbeat, as well as masking her true intentions when it comes to the male lead, and both of those features show up in CSM as well. FLCL and CSM also both follow the young male lead in his relationships with older women and examine the characters while doing so.",

It also contains great fights, good villains, and a story similar, and different then Naruto\u2019s.",

Differences: - Polar opposite settings, MTP is set around 1879, England and Psycho-Pass is set around 2113, in Japan. - MTP is adapted from manga, Psycho-Pass is original. - MTP is shonen, while Psycho-Pass being original does not have a confirmed demography but is mostly considered as seinen in fans. - MTP is not as realistic as Psycho-Pass, doesn't mean MTP is any less interesting. - MTP can be enjoyed more if you like characters but don't care about story, while its completely other way around Psycho-Pass. - Psycho-Pass heavily relies on Sci-Fi elements to move the story. - William is anti-hero and Shogo is anti-villian.",

As well as having this feeling of dread as we know many characters may die in any second and expecting our main character to exceed their limits once more. Demons in CSM act similar to the Yoma from Claymore in the sense that both differ from your redemptive villains as they just outright look at humans as inferior beings (as well as hiding their true form or potential), making them the perfect threat for us to sympathize with the people affected by them and cheer for the \"heroes\" even if some are shown to have not the best of intentions with them using the power of their enemies against them (contracts for CSM, Yoma energy for Claymore). I'd say they both contain gore and horror aspects that make it worth checking one or the other after watching either of them first especially if you like grittier and more mature themes with twists and turns.",

			"content": "The significant similarity between both is the difficult decisions made by creators (in this case, Gene a newbie director, and the Ashirogi Muto manga duo) to make a better product and consistent vision. I won't get into detail further than its synopses but for Gene acquiring his first directorial credit is a hard task as he has to work against a deadline and a heavy amount of workload unless he delays the project which could trample over the production, same with Bakuman. where the artist/author duo have to adjust to a weekly schedule to get the story, paneling, and art sorted out just to be thrown into another labor-filled week beset with the underlying dread of getting their series canceled, that is if they even make it as far as a one-shot story published in the magazine. Both have what you'd consider rivals but they're mostly sources of inspiration for the main characters as they are genius in their respective industries. For Pompo: The Cin\u00e9phile, well, who else but Pompo herself! A director who apparently only shoots B-grade flicks but created a magnificent script that she hands over for Gene to adapt. For Bakuman. there's Eiji Niizuma, a gifted mangaka that has no problems with his deadlines, almost like the story and art come naturally to him, and rises to the top ranking of the magazine. Still, remember they both have a somewhat idealized look at their corresponding industries even if they can be harsh and demonstrate the tense environment creators live in sometimes characters will do specific things that should create a massive stir-up with their peers and audience, that you can't visualize their superiors/higher-ups letting slide, yet get away with (albeit not unscathed mind you). I'd say Bakuman. is far more realistic with the kind of penalty you'd get if you pull a risky decision and ends up getting a fitting development all the way through (s1-3) while Pompo hastens over to a specific point by its ending.",
